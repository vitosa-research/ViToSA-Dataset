# ViToSA-Pipeline

Vietnamese Speech-to-Toxicity Analysis (ViToSA) Pipeline  
Combining PhoWhisper ASR and PhoBERT TSD for Vietnamese audio moderation.

---

## Overview

**ViToSA-Pipeline** provides an end-to-end Python interface for:
- Transcribing Vietnamese audio into text using ViToSA PhoWhisper ASR.
- Detecting and masking toxic words with ViToSA PhoBERT TSD.
- Optionally processing full directories of `.wav` files.

It is built on top of the **ViToSA 1.0 dataset**, the first Vietnamese dataset for audio-based toxic span detection, developed by the University of Information Technology (VNU-HCM).

### Abstract

Toxic speech in online platforms is a growing concern for user safety. While textual toxicity detection is well-studied, audio-based toxicity detection—especially for low-resource languages like Vietnamese—remains underexplored.

The ViToSA dataset introduces ~11,000 speech samples (≈25 hours) with human-annotated toxic spans, enabling ASR + Toxic Speech Detection (TSD) pipelines for Vietnamese. Experiments show that fine-tuning ASR models on ViToSA improves WER, and that text-based toxic span detection (TSD) models outperform baseline toxicity classifiers.

### Dataset Summary

| Split | # Examples | Notes |
|-------|------------|-------|
| Train | 8,641 | toxic only |
| Validation | 2,161 | toxic only |
| Test | 2,000 | balanced 50/50 toxic / non-toxic |

Each entry includes:
- `file_name`: audio file name
- `audio`: waveform (float32)
- `transcript`: human transcription
- `toxicity`: binary annotation

**Modalities:** Audio + Text  
**Language:** Vietnamese
